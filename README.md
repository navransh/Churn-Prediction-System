# Churn-Prediction-System
**Overview**

This Churn Prediction System is a machine learning project developed using Python. The goal of the project is to predict customer churn based on various features such as demographic information, transaction history, and customer behavior. The system leverages various classification algorithms to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave or stay.

**Features**

>**Data Preprocessing:**
>
Handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables.
>**Feature Engineering:**
>
Create new features from existing data, such as customer tenure or total transaction value.
>**Model Selection:**
>
Implement and compare multiple machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
>**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
>
Optimize models using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to improve performance.
>**Model Evaluation:**
>
Assess the models using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
>**Deployment:**
>
> The system can be deployed as an API using Flask or FastAPI to make real-time predictions.
